# Cochi's Kitchen Menu Items

## Project Overview
This directory contains images for Cochi's Kitchen menu items. The images are used on the restaurant's website to showcase their offerings.

## Current Status
- We've created a comprehensive menu checklist based on the restaurant's website and online reviews
- We've generated placeholder SVG images for several key menu items
- Due to restrictions on directly accessing social media platforms, we couldn't automatically download actual food photos

## Image Files
The following placeholder images have been created:
1. menu-breakfast-burrito.svg
2. menu-bialy-sando.svg 
3. menu-breakfast-tacos.svg
4. menu-breakfast-bowl.svg
5. menu-trendy-sandwich.svg
6. menu-chorizo-breakfast-sandwich.svg
7. menu-cookies-and-cream-scone.svg

## Next Steps

   - Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/cochibbq/
   - Yelp: https://www.yelp.com/biz/cochis-kitchen-morgan-hill

2. Download actual food photos for each menu item
   - Use the naming convention: menu-[item-name].jpg or menu-[item-name].png
   - Replace the placeholder SVGs with these actual photos

3. Update the menu-checklist.txt file as you add real photos
