Cochi's Kitchen was founded by husband and wife team, Manny and Gabby Vasquez. Their journey began by catering for a tech company in Silicon Valley, and by March 2018 they were providing over 400 meals daily. Like many businesses during the pandemic, they had to pivot their model and began offering fried chicken sandwiches for pickup while expanding their catering services throughout Morgan Hill. The restaurant grew from these humble beginnings to establish their brick-and-mortar location in the Vineyard Town Center. Their deep community roots and commitment to quality have made them a beloved local establishment in Morgan Hill.
